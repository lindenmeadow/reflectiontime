# reflectiontime
This is a Sinatra CRUD app that I created as part of my studies in Flatiron School's web developer program. 

The purpose of the app, called ReflectionTime, is to allow elementary school students to create reflections on projects they have completed. Users will use a signup form to create a username and password, and of course they will use that username and password for future logins. They will be able to view other students' reflections, create/edit/delete project reflections of their own, and update their username/password.
